            <p style="font-weight: normal;;">The F-35B Lightning II is a fifth-generation multirole stealth fighter developed by Lockheed Martin for the
               U.S. Marine Corps and allied forces. It is part of the broader F-35 family, which includes the F-35A (conventional takeoff and landing)
               and the F-35C (carrier-based) variants. What distinguishes the F-35B is its short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) capability,
               made possible by a lift fan system and a rotating rear exhaust nozzle. This allows the aircraft to operate from shorter runways and
               amphibious assault ships, giving military forces more flexibility in deployment and operations.<br>

               Equipped with advanced stealth technology, the F-35B is difficult for radar systems to detect, making it a significant leap in
               survivability over older aircraft. It features a cutting-edge sensor suite and data fusion systems, which provide pilots with
               unprecedented situational awareness. The aircraft can perform a variety of missions, including air-to-air combat, close air support,
               and intelligence gathering. Its ability to act as a networked node in a larger battlefield system makes it a force multiplier,
               capable of sharing real-time data with other aircraft, ground forces, and command centers.</p>
